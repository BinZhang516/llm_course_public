The air holds its breath, thick with the scent of cooling earth and distant rain, while clouds drift like slow-moving ships sailing toward some unknown horizon. In this moment, the sky is not merely above—it is *within*, a mirror to the quiet ache of things ending and beginning again."

       "      – When the comoving enclosed mass exceeds the effective Chandrasekhar limit for the prevailing lepton fraction Y_L≈0.35, no cold EOS can supply P>ρc²/3 and the collapse proceeds irreversibly.  \n",
       "      – A bounce-shock forms at nuclear density (ρ≈2.7×10¹⁴ g cm⁻³), but for E_explode < E_binding (typically ≲10⁵¹ erg) the shock stalls and ~0.1–0.5 M⊙ is accreted within ≤1 s, pushing the proto-neutron star above the maximum stable mass M_TOV≈2.2–2.4 M⊙ (EOS dependent).  \n",
       "      – Continued accretion or a late-time nuclear phase transition (e.g. quark deconfinement) can then drive the remnant past the instability limit, producing a black hole with horizon formation signalled by the disappearance of the neutrino luminosity L_ν on a millisecond time-scale.  \n",

       "      – Recent Kepler/K2 surveys find ≥20–30% of 20–40 M⊙ stars vanish optically, consistent with 3D neutrino-radiation-hydrodynamics models in which the shock is never revived. The entire progenitor (>5 M⊙) collapses quietly, emitting a brief ≤10⁵² erg neutrino burst but no luminous supernova.\n",

The collapse proceeds via the “bars-within-bars” instability, creating a quasi-star that later collapses relativistically.  \n",
       "   – Growth: After a seed forms, Eddington-limited accretion at λ_Edd≈1 yields exponential mass growth M(t)=M₀ exp(t/t_Sal), where t_Sal=4.5×10⁷ (ε/0.1) yr and ε is the radiative efficiency. Observed quasars at z≳7 imply sustained λ_Edd≳0.3, requiring super-Eddington slim-disk solutions or episodic accretion with duty-cycle f_duty≈0.1–0.5. Spin-up leaves dimensionless spin a_*≳0.7, consistent with X-ray reflection measurements.\n",

       "– Cosmic censorship: numerical relativity shows that generic, non-spherical collapse with angular momentum parameter j≡cJ/GM² < 1 still produces a Kerr black hole; naked singularities require extreme fine tuning.  \n",
       "– Minimum mass: stable neutron-star maximum M_TOV sets the lower BH mass limit; current EOS constraints give M_TOV≥2.2 M⊙ at 95% credibility.\n",
